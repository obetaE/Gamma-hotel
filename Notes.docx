Your Palette:
#1b0136 (Deep Purple): Great as the primary background color.
#8c18a7 (Bright Purple): A bold accent for buttons or highlights.
#0c0115 (Very Dark Purple): Ideal for footer or subtle contrasts.
#974649 (Muted Burgundy): Adds warmth, great for decorative elements.
#31203a (Charcoal Purple): Use as a secondary background or card color.
#020202 (Dark Violet): Works well for hover effects or subtle accents.

A Vibrant Accent: Consider Electric Blue (#7DF9FF) or Neon Pink (#FF1493) for extra pop.
